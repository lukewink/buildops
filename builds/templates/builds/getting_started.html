    <h1>Getting Started</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>This service works by allowing clients to POST new builds via HTTP.  The server will then save the POSTed build
       information and generate a build number for that build.</p>
    <p>New builds are added by making a HTTP POST to <a href>{{ builds_handler }}</a>.  The Content-Type of the POST
       should be application/json and the POST data should look like:
        <code class="prettyprint">
            <pre>
                {
                    "component" : "vxstorage",
                    "version_base" : "1.12.1",
                    "branch" : "master",
                    "revision" : "dd67c3af83b0571cea6bd799b20a58344df825f5"
                }
            </pre>
        </code>
        <ul>
            <li><b>component:</b> The name of the component being built.  This value is case insensitive ("VxStorage"
                                  and "vxstorage") will match each other.</li>
            <li><b>version_base:</b> This is the version of the component being built (with no build number included of
                                     course.  This will typically be 3 numbers: <i>major.minor.patch</i></li>
            <li><b>branch:</b> An optional field specifying which branch the build is coming from.</li>
            <li><b>revision:</b> An optional field specifying the revision of the source code.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>If successful, the result of the POST will be the newly create Build object.  This Build object will contain
       the assigned build number.</p>
